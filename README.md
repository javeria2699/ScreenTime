# ScreenTime
# Screen Time Analysis with SQL 📱📊


### 📌 Project Description

This SQL-based project focuses on analyzing screen time and app usage behavior to derive meaningful insights into productivity and digital habits. Using a custom-built relational database with tables for users, apps, and usage logs, the project simulates a realistic dataset for analyzing:

- Total screen time and app engagement patterns  
- Productivity levels based on app categories  
- Most addictive apps based on launches per minute  
- User-level breakdowns of productive vs. unproductive usage  
- YouTube-related activity including views, likes, and comments  

The project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques such as:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Aggregate functions and grouping  
- Conditional filtering and logic  
- JOINs across normalized tables  

This analysis can support digital wellbeing initiatives, productivity monitoring, or tech usage audits for individuals and organizations.
